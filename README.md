# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This project focuses on the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately diagnose and classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy in retinal images.

## Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye disease that affects the blood vessels in the retina. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning models to automate the detection process and provide timely diagnosis.

## Features

- Utilizes deep learning techniques for the detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy.
- Provides a reliable and efficient solution for early detection and diagnosis.
- Supports the classification of retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy.
- Can be used for screening purposes in healthcare settings to identify high-risk patients.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetic-retinopathy-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd diabetic-retinopathy-detection`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Obtain a dataset of retinal images labeled with diabetic retinopathy severity.
2. Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, or augmenting the data if needed.
3. Train the diabetic retinopathy detection model using the provided training script: `python train.py`.
4. Evaluate the trained model on a test dataset: `python evaluate.py`.
5. Use the trained model to predict diabetic retinopathy severity in new retinal images by running the `predict.py` script.
