# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This project focuses on the detection of diabetic retinopathy, a common eye disease that affects people with diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision problems and, in severe cases, blindness. Early detection and timely treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss.

## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. The model will be trained on a dataset of retinal images, where each image is labeled with the corresponding diabetic retinopathy severity level. The severity levels typically range from 0 (no retinopathy) to 4 (severe retinopathy).

Diabetic retinopathy detection involves several steps, including preprocessing of retinal images, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The trained model can then be used to predict the severity level of diabetic retinopathy in new, unseen retinal images.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies will be used for this project:

- Python: The programming language used for implementing the diabetic retinopathy detection model.
- Google Colab: An online platform for running Python code and Jupyter notebooks.
- TensorFlow: An open-source deep learning framework that provides tools and libraries for building and training neural networks.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow, simplifying the process of building and training deep learning models.
- OpenCV: A computer vision library in Python that provides various image processing and analysis functions.

## Steps

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of retinal images for diabetic retinopathy detection. The dataset should contain retinal images along with their corresponding severity level labels.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the retinal images to enhance their quality and remove noise. This step may involve tasks such as resizing, cropping, normalization, and denoising.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed retinal images. This can be done using techniques such as edge detection, texture analysis, and color analysis.

4. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a deep learning model on the training data using the extracted features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for this task.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing data. Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to predict the severity level of diabetic retinopathy in new retinal images.

## Code Implementation

The code for this project can be found in the `diabetic_retinopathy_detection.ipynb` file. It is implemented using Python and can be run on Google Colab.

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Open the `diabetic_retinopathy_detection.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Make sure you have a dataset of retinal images for diabetic retinopathy detection. If not, you can use publicly available datasets or create your own.
3. Upload the dataset to Google Colab.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Please note that the code provided in the `diabetic_retinopathy_detection.ipynb` file is a sample implementation. You may need to modify it according to your specific dataset and requirements.

## Conclusion

Diabetic retinopathy detection is an important application of machine learning and computer vision in the medical field. By developing a model that can accurately detect the severity level of diabetic retinopathy, we can assist healthcare professionals
